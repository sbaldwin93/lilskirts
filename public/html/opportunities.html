	<h4 class="state">Is Li’l Skirts™ right for me?</h4>
	<p class="parag">An innovative, woman-owned handcrafted goods company out of Colorado, Li’l Skirts™ Fashion, Accessories and Gifts, seeks representatives—we call them Trunk Show Stylists—who love fashion, accessories and handcrafted gifts that are all MADE IN THE USA.  Ideal candidates will be enthusiastic entrepreneur types interested in building their own stylish business.</p>
	<h4 class="state">There are only two requirements:</h4>
	<p class="parag">1)  You must be ethical, honest, friendly, approachable, kind to everyone (including small animals!) and have a positive outlook on life</p>
	<p class="parag">2)  You must have basic computing skills— internet access and a droid app phone or iphone are required to process sales!</p>
	<h4 class="state">Launched in June of 2013, Li’l Skirts™ is growing extremely fast­—and we currently offer two Stylist opportunities:</h4>
	<p class="parag">Regional Stylist Maven:  You are an entrepreneurial spirit who wants to be in on the ground floor of an awesome new business offering Li’l Skirts™ fashion, accessories and gifts—all MADE IN THE USA—to your large social network of friends and community!  Your goal is to build a business that offers you FREEDOM and FLEXIBILITY to be your own boss.  Your sales goals are UNLIMITED! You’re willing to maintain and manage inventory for a region, recruit other Stylist Mavens and support the Stylists in your region—from their inventory needs to their marketing strategies!  You recognize this as a ground floor opportunity with a newly launched company and plan to go for it knowing that the income potential is directly related to your entrepreneurial efforts!</p>
	<p class="parag">Stylist Maven:  You love your work but want to supplement your income offering Li’l Skirts™ fashion, accessories and handcrafted gifts—all MADE IN THE USA—to your social network of friends!  You are interested in booking one to two trunk shows per month (home trunk shows or holiday bazaars, festivals, etc.) with a minimum sales goal of 30 skirts per month, or equivalent total sales revenue of $1500 to $2500 per month.  You may share the opportunity recruiting other Stylist Mavens so you can enjoy override commissions from their sales but are never required to do so!  Average commissions at home trunk shows and events are $35 to $100 per hour!</p>
	<p class="parag">Whether you’re someone interested in a little extra income or you’re looking to build a new empire, Li’l Skirts™ provides a unique MADE IN THE USA handcrafted product line and our unique IMMEDIATE DELIVERY trunk show model makes it easy to offer our goods to your social network of friends!  Unlike other trunk show opportunities, your friends won’t leave your trunk show empty handed (or holding simply a completed order form for their “made somewhere overseas” goods!)</p>
	<p class="parag">Because all Li’l Skirts™ handcrafted products are one-of-a-kind and MADE IN THE USA, your customers leave a trunk show with their shopping bag full of the products they select!  You are able to enjoy more sales because you can capture impulse purchases by proudly offering your friends and customers our unique handcrafted items!  It’s like setting up a popup “Li’l Skirts™ Handcrafted Boutique,” selling your inventory on hand with no order taking necessary!  You will automatically receive a refill from Li’l Skirts™ to replace the items you sold within a couple of weeks!</p>
	<p class="parag">No gimmicks or complicated compensation plans.  You don’t pay for inventory up front and you don’t have to pass out order forms for a future delivery date!  You simply sell our one-of-a-kind handcrafted in the USA Li’l Skirts™ fashion, accessories and gifts that we deliver to your door by booking home or business-hosted trunk shows, or booking trunk show booths at holiday bazaars and festivals. All sales are processed through Li’l Skirts™ so you just ring them up on your smart phone app and watch your friends’ eyes light up as they leave with their purchases in hand and don’t have to wait or pay for shipping for their goods!  We  provide each Li’l Skirts™ Stylist with great training, tools and support for their Li’l Skirts™ business.</p>
	<h4 class="state">YES, IT’S THAT EASY!</h4>
